  <h2>Product Review: Bang & Olufsen H6</h2>
  <p>Bang &amp; Olufsenâ€™s new BeoPlay headphone range have finally made their classic high end audio something that is attainable by the average consumer. At AUD$499, the H6 is still sadly on the less affordable end of the spectrum, however their beauty, comfort, and sound quality can not be matched by any other headphone set in this price range. The sound of the H6 is unique - very well defined and balanced, with no one element ever outshining another. They are also incredibly well designed, not only in the sense that they look elegant and beautifully crafted&mdash;though they do&mdash;but also in the many small features that make the H6 a pleasure to use. With two audio ports, one on each side, you are not only able to plug your headphone cable into whichever side is most convenient for you, but you also have the ability to allow others to plug their headphones directly into yours in order to share your music. The level of noise reduction is also impressive, as H6 effectively blocks out a portion of external sound, without cutting you off completely. It is no secret that Bang &amp; Olufsen are famous for sound systems that sound perfect and look stunning, so it is interesting to note that one of the best features of the H6 is the fact that it is exceptionally comfortable. The ear pads are crafted from lambskin and contain what B&amp;O describes as memory foam, meaning that they are remarkably soft and manage to shape perfectly around your ears without ever feeling tight or constricting.</p>
