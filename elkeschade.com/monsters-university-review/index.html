  <h2>Film Review: Monsters University</h2>
  <p>There is a reason why Monsters University is the perfect film for any young audience.</p>

<p>It is not because of the characters, though they are in equal parts likeable, relatable, and genuinely funny. Even the stereotypical bad guys successfully walk the line between cartoonish caricature and the kind of person that everyone has actually met and had to deal with in their life time. Together, the film manages to paint an almost realistic picture of the kind of people we may encounter while growing up.</p>

<p>It is not because of the prequel concept - which had avid fans of the franchise worried for many years prior to the film’s release, but that in fact proved itself to be astoundingly effective. Discovering the humble beginnings of our beloved heroes proves itself to be much more interesting than rehashing the themes and settings already explored by the previous film.</p>

<p>Equally, it is not because of the underlying message of the “Oozma Kappa” team, only joined by Mike and Sulley in desperation, and who are considered desperately uncool by the larger community (that is, until they manage to pull together and effectively prove everybody wrong during the “Scare Games”). While the underdog trope is always effective in teaching us not to be judgemental or cruel, this is not something in any way unique to this film alone. </p>

<p>The real reason why Monsters University is so powerful is that Mike Wazowski, the character for whom the audience roots for and relates to the most, reaches the sudden and devastating realisation towards the end of the film that he will never be able to achieve his dreams. We watch Mike try everything to become a successful Scarer, and instead of seeing the success of all of his hard work, we are reminded that some things simply can not be learned. Most importantly, we are reminded that there is nothing wrong or shameful about changing your dreams to better fit your abilities.</p>

<p>Too many films aimed at younger audiences focus on the idea that anybody can achieve anything if they are passionate enough and willing to put in the time. While this is a pleasant idea and can act as an effective motivator, it is simply not always true. Mike Wazowski is not built to be a Scarer, the same way most people are not and never will be built to be a supermodel, intelligent enough to be a brain surgeon, or possess the vocal range to be an opera singer. The sooner Mike accepts his limitations and moves on, focusing on his strengths instead of his misplaced hopes, the more fulfilling his life becomes.</p>

<p>Monsters University is the perfect film for a younger audience because it reveals these harsh truths about life, while maintaining that they do not mean that Mike, or anybody, is less worthy of happiness because of them.</p>
