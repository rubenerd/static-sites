<p>Elke Schade is a twenty-four year old who currently resides in Sydney, Australia. Her background is both Australian and German, though she spent many of her formative years growing up in South East Asia. Moving to Singapore in 1998 and then to Kuala Lumpur in 2005, most of Elkeâ€™s Primary and High School education was at Australian International Schools.</p>

<p>After moving back to Australia permanently in 2010, Elke attended the University of Technology, Sydney, from which she has recently graduated with an Honours degree in Communication: Writing and Cultural Studies. During her time at UTS, Elke was an active volunteer in the Peer Networking program assisting new students during Orientation, and she remains a proud member of the Golden Key Society.</p>

<p>Since 2011, Elke has worked at a leading IT retail store as a Sales Specialist. The many responsibilities that she has taken on within this role have given her a keen understanding of what it means to provide premium level customer service. Working closely with both mobile and desktop devices have also left Elke with a huge amount of consumer IT knowledge. While she primarily uses Apple devices, she is also very familiar with other platforms, such as Windows.</p>

<p>Elke is a freelance writer and editor, as well as a hobbyist photographer. In her spare time she enjoys a wide variety of music, films and television shows, and her overseas upbringing has kindled a passion for travel. Her repertoire of interests also includes fashion, food, feminism, politics, and fitness.</p>

<p>As an avid IT and Social Media enthusiast, Elke is active on a wide variety of social networking sites, including:</p>
