  <h2>Fiction: Annie</h2>
  <p>Annie always used to eat rice crackers. She didn’t dip them in anything, or spread peanut butter on them, or put a slice of cheese between two to make a little rice cracker sandwich. She’d just sit there, on her own, and eat them plain.</p>

<p>It was the first thing Sam noticed about her, back when he was barely old enough to be taking much notice of anything. He thought it was odd, that crackers needed a little something more to be really tasty, and one day, on impulse, he walked right up and told her so.</p>

<p>For a fleeting moment, she looked as though she would cry, but it passed quickly. Instead she responded by silently holding out one of the crackers for him. It dawned on him that, for some reason, he didn&#39;t want to hurt her - this strange little girl with big dark eyes and neat blonde pigtails who ate food that didn&#39;t make any sense. He took it and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>He stared at the cracker for a moment before finally taking a small bite, and in the end it really wasn&#39;t as bad as all that. He looked at her. She smiled at him.</p>

<p>Years later, when she offered him his first cigarette, he&#39;d learned not to hesitate. He took it without thinking, and wasn&#39;t even angry when she laughed at him for coughing so much that he almost vomited all over her school shoes.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it,&quot; she said, grinning. And he did.</p>

<p>When her parents caught them smoking in her garden shed, he panicked and told them it was all his idea. Annie was a fantastic liar, a picture of sincerity and honest confusion, and they believed her immediately. Sam was a bad influence. His jeans were too big and his hair was always erring on the messy side of too long, and of course he smoked. Of course he tried to force their sweet innocent daughter to follow suit. </p>

<p>He could not see any reason to tell them the truth; it seemed as though everyone involved was happier with the lie. Annie always had so much more to lose than Sam, so it seemed only fair for him to take the fall for her. If he was perfectly honest with himself, he would know that he&#39;d take the fall for her for anything. </p>

<p>Now Annie&#39;s parents think the entire thing is Sam&#39;s fault. They haven&#39;t said anything to him about it directly – in fact, they haven&#39;t said anything to him at all, even though they both arrived well over an hour ago, which is probably more telling than anything. It&#39;s in the looks they&#39;ve been shooting him around their glasses, in the way they didn&#39;t introduce him to anybody. Especially in the way they made him sit right up the back, like he&#39;s just some long lost relative that didn&#39;t know her at all.</p>

<p>Just before the service starts the man sitting next to him, a chubby, middle-aged lump of a gentleman who&#39;s severely underdressed in jeans and a white t-shirt, leans over and asks who Annie was.</p>

<p>“She&#39;s from the wife&#39;s side,” he explains, with an apologetic smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes. “Don&#39;t think I ever met her, but thought I better check. People get sensitive about this stuff. Annabelle, was it?”</p>

<p>Sam glances down at the programme in his hand, where the name Annabelle Green is written in fancy italic text beneath her last school photo. She always hated that photo, and besides, it&#39;s almost three years old by now. He wonders if it was the most recent photo her parents could find, or if they&#39;d rejected newer ones because of the messy washed out colour in her hair. He bitterly suspects the latter, but to be fair he never heard Annie talk about sending them a picture. They&#39;d never visited to take one for themselves.</p>

<p>“No, it- just Annie. Her name was Annie.”</p>

<p>Her parents had blamed Sam when Annie moved to the city, too, though of course it was James&#39;s decision as well. James had arrived in town when they were still in primary school, moving into the big house at the end of Sam’s street with his parents and three brothers and a little yappy dog with curly brown fur. He was always talking at length about the Big City where he’d come from, long after, Sam secretly suspected, his actual memories of it had faded.</p>

<p>It had been Annie herself that had first suggested the move, first put words to the idea that had always been lurking silently in the back of all of their minds, but that was obviously not something her parents ever wanted to consider. He can&#39;t entirely blame them, and besides, James was always a good boy. With his shiny blonde hair and his tucked in shirts and his perfect grades all the way through school - it would seem unsporting to blame him for anything.</p>

<p>Despite all their planning, talking about it over and over again for years, in the end it all seemed to happen overnight. One day the three of them were sneaking around the back of the gymnasium at recess to steal a few private moments and have a couple of smokes, always talking idly about The Future, as though it were so far off to not even be worth considering in any kind of depth. The next, it seemed, their bags were packed and they were catching the 7 o&#39;clock train and leaving it all behind.</p>

<p>“We did it,” Annie had said, with a wicked smile, and Sam never even thought to look back at everything they’d lost. As far as he was concerned, there was nothing worth looking back for.</p>

<p>He cranes his neck, trying to find James among all of the guests. He’s sure he’s come across most of these people before through all his years living in town, but now the faces all seem to blur together. Certainly none of them seem to recognise him. Down in front a stream of light bounces off pale hair, and he finally spots James in the second row, sitting with his family, talking in a low voice to his older brother. He’s clean shaven and wearing a stiff, expensive looking suit - which Annie would have mocked him for endlessly if she’d been there to see it - and he and his brothers all match perfectly. He doesn’t look back at Sam.</p>

<p>James had asked him, once, if he was in love with Annie.</p>

<p>It had been an impossibly long night that had slowly begun to blur into a haze of alcohol and too much smoke, and Sam was in that murky place somewhere between drunk and high and half asleep where he couldn’t quite tell if he was enjoying himself or not. It took a moment for his brain to process what James had asked, and when it sunk in he let out a surprised huff of a laugh. </p>

<p>He tried to appear unaffected but couldn’t follow through, not meeting James’s eyes and instead staring unblinkingly somewhere over his left shoulder. </p>

<p>&quot;Sure. I mean, she&#39;s my best friend, isn&#39;t she? Sure I do. I mean- do you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,” James said, leaning back in his chair and smiling up at the ceiling. He took a long drag of his cigarette and blew two perfect streams out his nostrils. “But, you know, I think it&#39;s different. I think you love her differently.&quot;</p>

<p>At the time, Sam had given a derisive snort and proceeded to collapse on the nearest vaguely soft surface - the carpet, which was not actually all that soft, when you got down to it - and pretend to fall asleep. The conversation was giving him a prickly feeling of unease between his shoulder blades, whose source he didn&#39;t want to try and identify, and he just wanted to escape the whole thing as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Thankfully, in a rare demonstration of tact, or possibly because he, too, had fallen asleep, James let it go and fell silent. He never mentioned it again, and Sam is surprised he even remembers the exchange at all, but he does. It lingers uncomfortably in the back of his mind, and he sometimes wonders if James has any recollection of it. He doesn’t really want to find out.</p>

<p>If Annie&#39;s parents had their way, she and James would have been married years ago, maybe even with a baby on the way by now. They would have stayed here in town and lived their lives exactly as all the other families had lived before them, without hair dye or cigarettes or anything else that would make the neighbours gasp and gossip behind their backs. Sam would never have been in the picture at all, except perhaps lurking somewhere in the background to serve as an example of a Bad Person, and everybody else would have been happy.</p>

<p>Except, of course, that Annie still would have died.</p>

<p>He’d got the call about a week ago. She’d fallen, she said, and hit the back of her head on one of the display cases at work.</p>

<p>He was worried about her, of course, but he was always worried about her, in one way or another. Several times she had told him that it annoyed her, that she was perfectly capable of taking care of herself, and he was far too over protective of her. It didn’t stop him from worrying  - he just started worrying in silence, chewing the inside of his mouth and fiddling with the ends of his hair. </p>

<p>“It’s nothing,” she explained. “They just want to keep me here overnight, observe me or some shit. Can you bring me some clothes? And, like, a book, or something? There isn’t even a fucking TV here.” </p>

<p>When he arrived, saw her lying there - in a hospital bed, in a hospital robe, with a tube sticking out of the back of her hand and her head all bandaged - the first thing he suggested was to bail and get the next train back home. He knew, logically, that it wouldn&#39;t make any difference where she was, but he could picture the little family doctor’s office down the road from Annie’s house, where he’d been a million times with various scrapes, breaks, and sniffles, and with it came a sense of security that he wasn’t expecting. He hadn’t thought of that place in a long time.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said, scoffing. &quot;Come on Sammy, the doctors back there are useless.&quot;</p>

<p>Sam nodded. He&#39;d expected as much. He glanced around the room, his eyes darting about nervously. There was something about hospitals that had never agreed with him. They were too sterile, with too many pastel walls and the same pointless landscape paintings on every available surface. The one hanging above her bed was of a mountain shrouded in fog, and he could swear he’d seen the same one in every hospital room he’d ever been in in his life.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to him that he should have brought flowers, or some kind of stuffed animal to give to her. He shoved his hands in his pockets, awkwardly, wishing there was somewhere for him to sit down. In the end, he settled for easing himself down on the edge of her bed, wincing as he felt it dip and groan beneath his weight. </p>

<p>&quot;Should I, um, call your parents, then? Or, should James call them? Or do you think-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Christ, no. The way my mother worries? She&#39;ll have an aneurism right on the spot.&quot;</p>

<p>Annie insisted that she was fine, that it was just a silly headache and that the doctors were trying to charge them more by keeping her longer. When Sam offered to talk to them for her she refused, telling him to stop dithering, and she looked fine, really, except for a certain tiredness around her eyes. </p>

<p>He noticed with a shock that she wasn&#39;t wearing nail polish, and for some reason that bothered him more than it should. It occurred to him that he&#39;d never seen her without at least a chipped fleck or two, not since they were children and their fingers were always far too dirty and their nails much too short. He wondered if they&#39;d removed it for her, or if she&#39;d done it herself. </p>

<p>“You could bring me some smokes, though,” she said, her voice hopeful, and he laughed.</p>

<p>“What, you want to smoke in a hospital room?”</p>

<p>“Why the hell not? What’s it going to do, make me sick?”</p>

<p>The next day, feeling sorry for her, he woke up early and brought her her favourite nail polish. It was dark purple, with bright flecks of red and pink glitter that shone when the light passed it. He’d bought it for her birthday that year. It wasn’t a cigarette, but he thought it might cheer her up for a while, at least.</p>

<p>By the time he arrived, her bed was empty.</p>

<p>“Oh. Did you know her well?”</p>

<p>He turns his head, and sees that the man still has the same sympathetic smile plastered on his face. He doesn&#39;t understand why the guy insists on attempting to make conversation with him - he knows he looks like absolute hell, and he’s certain a funeral is the one place on Earth where you&#39;re supposed to leave people alone if they look like they need it. Then again, jeans and a t-shirt are not exactly typical funeral attire, and he supposes it’s possible the man has never been to a funeral before. </p>

<p>The thought makes Sam feel incredibly young, makes him think that surely no-one his age should ever have to be at a funeral for their best friend. Surely no-one should be allowed to reach this tactless fat man’s age and never have to have been to one at all.</p>

<p>Surely no-one like Annie should have to die.</p>

<p>He clears his throat to dislodge the tightness that’s forming there, has been forming for days, now, despite all his best efforts to ignore it, but it doesn’t work. His voice still comes out with an unpleasant rasp, and doesn’t even really sound like his to his own ears. He glances involuntarily in James’s direction.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” he says. “I did.”</p>
