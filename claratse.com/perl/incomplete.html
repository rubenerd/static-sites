<h2>QUESTION 4 QUESTION</h2>

<pre>4) (Challenge Question) Write a perl program that will convert dates between formats. eg a date may be written in the form:
12/12/2005 ( dd/mm/yyyy )
or in the form:
12 December 2005

Your progam will accept a date in either format on the command line and will print out the same date in the opposite format. If an invalid date is put in (eg 45/3/2003) then the progam will print an error message stating that the date is invalid.

Your program should have a minimum of 2 subroutines (eg one to convert from type x to type y and another to convert from type y to type x) but you may find that you can implement more subroutines (eg there may be a subroutine that validates dates).
NOTE: See this weeks notes for a brief overview of efficient use of subroutines.

For the converting of months you should store the months in an array. Consider which array may be more useful, a hash or a normal array.

<h2>QUESTION 4 ANSWER</h2>

The following is a little verbose and only
does a few basic checks on the format.
#!/usr/bin/perl

%WordToDigit = qw (January  1 February 2 March 3 April 4 May 5 June 6 July 7 August 8 September 9 October 10 November 11 December 12);
@DigitToWord = qw (January February March April May June July August September October November December);

sub ValidDay($)
{
  $iDay = $_[0];

  if (($iDay>31) ||($iDay<1))
  {
    return 0;
  }
    return 1;
}

sub ValidMonth($)
{
$iMonth = $_[0];


if (($iMonth>12) ||($iMonth<1))
{
return 0;
}
return 1;
}

sub ConvertDigitsToWords($@)
{
($iIndex,@WordArray) = @_;
return $WordArray[$iIndex];
}

sub ConvertWordsToDigit($%)
{
($strKey,%Array) = @_;
return $Array{$strKey};
}





while ($_ = <STDIN>)
{
  chomp($_); #important; otherwise, '\n' in $_

  if (m/(\d{1,2})\/(\d{1,2})\/(\d{4,4})/)
  {
    print "Found digit format: " . $& . "\n";
    print "Individual parts are $1 $2 $3 \n";
    if ((ValidDay($1)) && (ValidMonth($2)) )
    {
    printf("%d %s %d",$1,ConvertDigitsToWords($2-1,@DigitToWord),$3);
}
else
{
print "Error bad day or month \n";
}
  }
  elsif(m/(\d{1,2})\s(\D{3,12})\s(\d{4,4})/)
  {
  print "Individual parts are $1 $2 $3 \n";
 
  print "Found word format "  .  $& . "\n";
  if ((ValidDay($1)) )
  {
$iMonth = ConvertWordsToDigit($2,%WordToDigit);
if ($iMonth<1)
{
print" error bad month\n";
}
else
{
    printf("%d/%d/%d",$1,$iMonth,$3);
}
}
else
{
print "Error bad day \n";
}
  }
  else
  {
  print "Error bad date format Expecting dd/mm/yyyy or dd MonthInWords yyyy\n";
}
 
}

<h2>QUESTION 5 QUESTION</h2>

<p>5) (a) Write a perl program that reads in a text file containing
one word per line. Create a hash containing the words read as
keys and the number of times they have been read as the value.
Print out each word and its frequency.<br />
<br />
(b) Expand the program you wrote in 5 (a) so that it can handle
a text file with more than one word per line. Note, the words are separated by spaces. Print out each word and its frequency.</p>
