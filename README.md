# static-sites

This serves as a backup for my various static sites. With one git clone in /var from a trusty Ansible script, I can restore several sites to my ~~VPS~~ cloud instance, and track their changes.

My primary site and blog is over on [Rubénerd](https://rubenerd.com/) thesedays, which is hosted in its [own repo](https://github.com/rubenerd/rubenerd-com).

## Sites here
