# static-sites

This serves as a backup for my various static sites. With one git clone in /var, I can restore several sites to my ~~VPS~~ cloud instance, and track their changes.

My primary site and blog are over on [Rubenerd.com](https://rubenerd.com/) thesesdays, which is hosted in its [own repo](https://github.com/RubenSchade/rubenerd-com).

## Sites here

* [elkeschade.com](http://elkeschade.com/) - my sister's old review site
* [grease.cc](http://grease.cc/) - my father's consulting business card
* [ruben.coffee](http://ruben.coffee/) - my pointless site for a new pointless TLD
* [sasara.moe](http://sasara.moe) - my tribute to everyone's favourite ToHeart 2 character
* [tigerintherain.com](http://tigerintherain.com/) - tribute to Michael Franks
